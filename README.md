# A/B Testing for a Marketing Campaign :dollar:
## Objective:
The primary objective of conducting an A/B test on a marketing campaign is to scientifically **evaluate and compare the performance of the control and test group to determine which one yields the most favorable and statistically significant results.**

## Project Description :open_file_folder:
In this project, I will do the following:
- Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents
- Clean the data, handle missing values
- Formulate null and alternative hypotheses for the test
- Ensure that the assignment of subjects to control (A) and treatment (B) groups is randomized and unbiased
- Determine the key metrics and performance indicators that will be used to evaluate the impact of the changes
- Perform the A/B test by comparing the performance of the control group (A) and treatment group (B) with respect to the chosen metrics
- Calculate relevant statistics, including p-values and confidence intervals, to assess the statistical significance of the results
- Visualize and interpret any trends or differences between the A and B groups.
